h1. Cycle.vim

A vim plugin that allows you to toggle between pairs or lists of related words. The
default mappings are the same as those with which you can increment and decrement
a number under the cursor: <code><C-A></code> and <code><C-X></code>, respectively.

h2. Customization

You can add your own word groups too:

<pre><code>
  call AddCycleGroup(['one', 'two', 'three'])
</code></pre>

h2. Todo

# Filetype specific cycle groups (see endwise.vim for inspiration)
# The ability to handle pairs: quotes, brackets, html tags, etc.
# Operate on non-lowercase text and retain case
# Allow work on substrings - 8px, 8%, 8em
# Put cursor back at beginning of word if it started there

h2. Bugs

# Does not work with speeddating.vim - currently won't work if speeddating is installed.
# Calling Cycle from whitespace before a matching word does not behave well.
