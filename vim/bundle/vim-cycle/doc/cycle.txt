ABOUT                                                                   *cycle*

Cycle.vim allows you to toggle between pairs or lists of related words. The
default mappings are the same as those with which you can increment and decrement
a number under the cursor — <C-A> and <C-X>, respectively.


CUSTOMIZATION

You can add your own word groups: >
