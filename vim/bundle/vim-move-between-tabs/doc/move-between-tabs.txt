INTRODUCTION                               move-between-tabs*

This plugin is for moving the current window between tabs.

To move the buffer from the current window to a window in the 
previous tab, call `MoveToPrevTab` or use the mapping `tP`.

To move to the next tab, use `MoveToNextTab` or `tN`.

To prevent the mappings from being set, set 
`g:surround_no_mappings` before the plugin is loaded.

If there is a tab in the direction the buffer is being moved to,
the current buffer will be added above the bottom right window on
the adjacent tab.

If there isn't a tab in the direction the buffer is being moved
to, a new tab will be created.
