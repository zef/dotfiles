# vim-move-between-tabs

This plugin is for moving the current window between tabs.

* To move the buffer from the current window to a window in the previous tab, call `MoveToPrevTab` or use the mapping `tP`.
* To move to the next tab, use `MoveToNextTab` or `tN`.
* To prevent the mappings from being set, set `g:surround_no_mappings` before the plugin is loaded.

If there is a tab in the direction the buffer is being moved to, the current
buffer will be added above the bottom right window on the adjacent tab.
If there isn't a tab in the direction the buffer is being moved to, a
new tab will be created.
